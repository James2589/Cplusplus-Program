# Cplusplus-Program

# Project summary

This project is for calculating annual interest for user defined variables total years, interest rate, initial deposit, and monthly deposit. This is meant as a financial planning tool.

# What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did a pretty good job incorporating OOP principles into this project. I also learned a lot about exception handling through this work and I feel that I did a good job implementing it into my code.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think added pointers would make this code a lot more efficient and secure. Pointers is something that I still need a lot of work on because I think they would greatly enhance my code. I could also use some sort of garbage collector within this project to make it a more practical program for actual use.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The biggest challenges in this project was properly formatting the output's. I was able to overcome this by just doing some research, investing a little time into finding additional resources really paid off normally I just go to the programming language's official page and look through their databases which can be really time consuming. I found that I can find an answer quicker by using stack overflow and reddit the other big pro to using these types of resources is that there is generally full explanations, tips, or even completely different options. I've learned a lot this way, things that I hadn't seen in any of my classes yet this really helps further my knowledge.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Creating user-interfaces with exception handling is something that will always be important, I also got a lot of experience with OOP as well as writing my own functions. These principles will always be relevant and are skills that I would like to continue to build upon as I continue my studies.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This program is maintainable due to have small simple functions, combined with inline comments making it easy to read. Since The functions are smaller they are easy to change and recycle. Change a few words and the user menu can be used for a completely different project as well. Everything broken down and organized into multiple classes also make's it easy to go through and debug, improve upon, and add to.
